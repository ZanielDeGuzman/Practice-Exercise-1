<p>Hi my name is Zaniel Mathew E. De Guzman. I’m 26 years of age. I’m from Santa Cruz, Laguna.</p>
<p>I completed my Bachelor’s Degree in Electrical Engineering in Laguna State Polytechnic University - Santa Cruz Campus. I come from a knit family where my parents has always encourage me to pursue my dreams. I enjoy and loved playing my guitar, jamming with my bandmates, and go hiking with my friends.</p>
<p>I hold a Bachelor’s Degree in Electrical Engineering. My first job is a Process Engineer at Manufacturing company in Laguna Technopark in Santa Rosa, Laguna. After 2 years, I was promoted as a Senior Process Engineer. For professional development and career growth, after 3 years and 4 months I left my first company and last year March 2023 I was hired in an Electronics Company in Laguna Science Park in Cabuyao, Laguna as a Process Engineer II and last May 2024 I left my current job to shift career in the field of technology</p>
<p>I’m a career shifter and I want to change my job because I want a role that has greater earning potential and where I can really get stuck into projects that excite me and that give me the opportunity to grow both personally and professionally.</p>
<p>My goal is to learn and grow in the field of technology, contributing to innovative solutions and making a positive impact.</p>
